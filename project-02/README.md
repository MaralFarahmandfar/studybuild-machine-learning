# 🚗 Traffic Volume Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes hourly westbound traffic volume on Interstate 94 (I-94) between Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota. The dataset contains traffic, weather, holiday, and time-related information collected from 2012 to 2018.

The main goal of this project is to explore the factors associated with variations in hourly traffic volume and identify meaningful patterns in traffic behavior across different times, weather conditions, and holidays.

### 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains **48,204 hourly observations** and **8 input features**, with `traffic_volume` as the target variable.

The data were collected from Minnesota Department of Transportation Automatic Traffic Recorder (ATR) station 301, located approximately midway between Minneapolis and St. Paul.
